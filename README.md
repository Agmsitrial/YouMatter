You know that fluid called "UU-Matter" from IndustrialCraft2, don't you? Well, here you have it as a standalone mod.
I added some quirks that make it slightly less overpowered, such as adding an extra requirement for producing U-Matter.
## Why?
ICÂ² is outdated, has many bugs and often is just included in modpacks because of its UU-Matter features. That was the inspiration for creating a standalone mod.
